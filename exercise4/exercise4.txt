## Part 1: Answer the 4 questions and submit as exercise4.txt

# The SPL of a signal at frequency band i is 76 dB. The (minimum) masking threshold value for band i is reported from the psychoacoustic model to be 70 dB.

# Q1) How can you evaluate the signal-to-mask ratio (SMR) for this band? What is the value?(0.25p)
ANS: SMR = Signal level - min( subband masking threshold ) so according to the formula, we get 76-70=6

# Q2) How many bits you need at least to represent the band's signal values with, if you can assume that the quantization noise decreases 6 dB by adding one bit? (0.25p)
ANS: SMR/6, so according to the formula, we get 6/6=1 bit      

# Q3) In the next frame (frame length is here 5 ms) the SPL suddenly drops to 40 dB (almost silent).
Based on the knowledge on the masking effect, explain how do you expect the masking threshold value to change from the last frames value (70dB)? 
#Is it closer to 40dB or 70dB? You can assume that adjacent bands are also silent. (0.25p)
ANS: It is near to 70 dB.
# Q4) How many uniform quantization steps there are with 6 bits? (0.125p) If maximum value is one, what is the step-size? (0.125p)
ANS: The uniform quantization steps: 2^6 = 64
The step-size is 1/ quantization steps , which is 1/64
