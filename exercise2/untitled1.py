##1. Follow the steps to implement filer banks and answer the questions (0.5 pt).
#!! FILL IN PARTS WITH "None"

#(1) load the sample
fs_org,x_org = wavfile.read('gtr55.wav')
x = signal.decimate(x_org,4,ftype='iir')
fs=fs_org/4

#(2) produces an MDCT filter-bank of M channels
def MDCT_FB(M):
    # Length (L) needs to be 2*M (one constraint for PR)
    vn=np.arange(int(M*2))

#(3) Applies each band filter to the input signal
# empty array for filterbank output

# Divide the input signal x into M critically sampled frequency bands.

# fs/25       
# - How many samples there are in the original signal "x" and how many samples in "y" (0.1 pt)
# There are 20009 samples in the "x" and there are 20025 samples in the "y".
#(4) reconstructs the signal ( combine filterbank output signals into a single signal )
# create a new full sampling rate signal with M channels
