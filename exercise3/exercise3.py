# Q1: Are correct peaks selected using thres=0.7, what happens if you set thres=0.5 (0.2 pt)?
# (hint: change the threshold value between 0 and 1, thres, and check if results are consistent)
#0.7 is good. most of the peaks have been selected. if i change it to 0.5, the result is not satisfying. Some non-peaks have also been chosen
# Q2: What is the fundamental frequency based on your plot, calculate the ratios: F1/F0, F2/F0 (0.2 pt)? 
# F0=246.346，2，3
# Q3: Is the audio recordings, oboe59, harmonic, why or why not? Answer the same question about the other recording,  gtr55  (0.2 pt)? 
# oboe59 is harmonic because the rest of the peaks are integer times of the fundamental frequency.
#but the gtr55 is not harmonic because F1/F0=8.7142, and F2/F0=20.857. they are not integer times of the fundamental frequency

# Q4: How does changing the modulation index affect the sound (0.2 pt)?
# Look at the spectrogram and listen, describe the sound change.
#when the value of ind_mod decreases, it could be noticed that the sound seems lower and lower not that sharp when ind_mod equals to 9
# Q5: Does the FM synthesis version sound different from the original signal (0.2 pt).
# List possible reasons, since both have same frequency components.
#yes, it is slightly different especially in the start, and in the middle, we could notice some noisy beeps
